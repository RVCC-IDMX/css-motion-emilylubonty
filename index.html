      <p class="motion-caption">
        This motion conveys an upward movement and slight enlargement. 
        It engages users by providing visual feedback with a smooth transition and slight scaling.

         SECTION 2: TIMING COMPARISON
         Two identical elements with different timing functions

      <h2>Timing Comparison</h2>

      <!-- Container for side-by-side comparison -->

        </div>

      </div>

      <!-- Explanation of timing differences -->
      <p class="motion-caption">
        Timing Function 1 uses a linear transition along with a longer, 1 second duration. 
        The duration appears slower than Timing Function 2, which uses a 500ms ease-out transition.
        Timing Function 2 feels quicker and more responsive due to the shorter duration and easing effect. 
        It is not as slow as Timing Function 1, making it feel more engaging and dynamic.

      <div class="accessibility-note">
        <h3>Reduced Motion Implementation</h3>
        <p>
          I handled prefers-reduced-motion by using global media queries to reduce or eliminate non-essential animations across all sections.
          By using global variables, this ensures all sections are accessible to users with motion sensitivities.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Personal reflection -->
      <div class="reflection-text">
        <h3>Design Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          The section that surprised me the most was timing. I experimented with different timing functions and discovered how slow or fast transitions can impact the user experience.
          I personally feel that the feature card best expresses my intent because it combines both engagement and interactivity. I feel
          that the flip motion can be useful for revealing additional information without overwhelming the user initially with walls of text or information.
          I learned that motion is a a design tool that can impact user engagement and overall feel of a website. 
          I also learned that different timing functions can envoke different feelings and responses from users, such as something being 
          too fast or too slow. It is also important to consder the accessibility of motion in design to ensure all users have a positive experience.
